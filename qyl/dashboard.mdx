# qyl Dashboard

The qyl dashboard is a React 19 SPA that provides real-time visualization of traces, logs, and GenAI telemetry.

## Features

### Theme Selection

<Frame>
  Switch between light, dark, and system themes using the theme toggle in the
  top bar.
</Frame>

| Mode   | Description                               |

### Download Logs

Export your telemetry data for offline analysis:

1. Navigate to any page (Logs, Traces, or GenAI)
2. Click the download button in the toolbar
3. Choose format: **JSON** or **CSV**
4. File downloads with timestamp in filename (e.g., `logs-2026-02-04T10-30-00.json`)

The export includes all visible columns and respects any active filters.

### Health Check Indicator

The health indicator in the top bar shows system status:

| Color     | Status    | Description              |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| 🟢 Green  | Healthy   | All systems operational  |
| 🟡 Yellow | Degraded  | Some components impaired |
| 🔴 Red    | Unhealthy | Critical issues detected |

Click the indicator to see detailed health information:

- DuckDB connection status
- Disk space usage
- Memory consumption
- Last ingestion time
- Uptime

Health checks auto-refresh every 30 seconds.

### Text Visualizer

Structured content (JSON, XML) is automatically detected and formatted:

<Accordion title="Features">

- **Auto-detection**: Recognizes JSON (`{` or `[`) and XML (`<`)
- **Syntax highlighting**: Color-coded keys, strings, numbers, booleans
- **Collapsible**: Large content shows truncated with "expand" option
- **Tree view**: Interactive expandable tree for JSON
- **Copy button**: One-click copy to clipboard

</Accordion>

### Pause & Clear Telemetry

Control telemetry ingestion and storage:

**Pause:**

- Click the "LIVE" button to pause real-time updates
- SSE streaming stops, existing data remains visible
- Click "PAUSED" to resume

**Clear:**

- Click the trash icon in the top bar
- Confirm in the dialog
- Options: Clear all, or by type (spans, logs, sessions)
- Data is permanently deleted from DuckDB

## GenAI Analytics

The GenAI page provides specialized views for LLM telemetry:

### Token Usage

Track token consumption across all models:

- Input tokens vs output tokens
- Cost calculations (USD)
- Model breakdown

### Tool Definitions

View tools available to AI models:

```json
{
  "name": "search_documents",
  "description": "Search the document database",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "query": { "type": "string" }
    }
  }
}
```

Tool definitions are extracted from the `gen_ai.tool.definitions` attribute.

### Tool Calls

See tool invocations with:

- Tool name and call ID
- Arguments passed
- Results returned
- Execution time

## Real-Time Streaming

The dashboard uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates:

```typescript
// Automatic connection to /api/v1/live
// New spans appear instantly in the UI
```

Connection status is shown in the top bar:

- **LIVE** (green): Connected and receiving updates
- **PAUSED** (yellow): Manually paused
- **DISCONNECTED** (red): Connection lost, will retry
