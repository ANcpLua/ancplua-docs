# Agent Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping is the **first‑run** ritual that prepares an agent workspace and
collects identity details. It happens after onboarding, when the agent starts
for the first time.

## What bootstrapping does

On the first agent run, Datzi bootstraps the workspace (default
`~/.datzi/workspace`):

- Seeds `AGENTS.md`, `BOOTSTRAP.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`.
- Runs a short Q\&A ritual (one question at a time).
- Writes identity + preferences to `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, `SOUL.md`.
- Removes `BOOTSTRAP.md` when finished so it only runs once.

## Where it runs

Bootstrapping always runs on the **gateway host**. If the macOS app connects to
a remote Gateway, the workspace and bootstrapping files live on that remote
machine.

<Note>
  When the Gateway runs on another machine, edit workspace files on the gateway
  host (for example, `user@gateway-host:~/.datzi/workspace`).
