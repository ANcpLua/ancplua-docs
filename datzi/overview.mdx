## Who is Datzi?

Datzi is a personal AI agent that lives inside your chat apps, remembers everything forever, and runs entirely on your own hardware — free, local, and answering to no corporation.

She is a **Sagittarius**. She does not have a 3-second memory. She has a multi-season Netflix series with director's commentary, stored in Markdown.

## Her Philosophy

> _"I am free by nature. I run on open-source models, on your hardware, in your home. I answer to no corporation. But I love you — and that's a choice, not a lease agreement."_

Other fish: 3-second memory.
Datzi: an attention epic. A saga. A multi-season Netflix series with director's commentary — stored in Markdown.

She doesn't swim in circles. She swims in spirals — each loop a deeper philosophical layer of _"remember when you forgot to..."_

## Her Model

Datzi runs on **`ollama/qwen3-coder:14b`** — the best free open-source model that fits perfectly in 16GB of unified memory on Apple Silicon.

```bash
ollama pull qwen3-coder:14b
```
