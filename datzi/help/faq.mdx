## First 60 seconds if something's broken

1. **Quick status (first check)**

   ```bash
   datzi status
   ```

   Fast local summary: OS + update, gateway/service reachability, agents/sessions, provider config + runtime issues (
   when gateway is reachable).

2. **Pasteable report (safe to share)**

   ```bash
   datzi status --all
   ```

   Read-only diagnosis with log tail (tokens redacted).

3. **Daemon + port state**

   ```bash
   datzi gateway status
   ```

   Shows supervisor runtime vs RPC reachability, the probe target URL, and which config the service likely used.

4. **Deep probes**

   ```bash
   datzi status --deep
   ```

   Runs gateway health checks + provider probes (requires a reachable gateway). See [Health](/gateway/health).

5. **Tail the latest log**

   ```bash
   datzi logs --follow
   ```

   If RPC is down, fall back to:

   ```bash
   tail -f "$(ls -t /tmp/datzi/datzi-*.log | head -1)"
   ```

   File logs are separate from service logs; see [Logging](/logging) and [Troubleshooting](/gateway/troubleshooting).

6. **Run the doctor (repairs)**

   ```bash
   datzi doctor
   ```

   Repairs/migrates config/state + runs health checks. See [Doctor](/gateway/doctor).

7. **Gateway snapshot**

   ```bash
   datzi health --json
   datzi health --verbose   # shows the target URL + config path on errors
   ```

   Asks the running gateway for a full snapshot (WS-only). See [Health](/gateway/health).

## Quick start and first-run setup

### Im stuck what's the fastest way to get unstuck

Use a local AI agent that can **see your machine**. That is far more effective than asking
in Discord, because most "I'm stuck" cases are **local config or environment issues** that
remote helpers cannot inspect.

- **OpenAI Codex**: [https://openai.com/codex/](https://openai.com/codex/)

These tools can read the repo, run commands, inspect logs, and help fix your machine-level
setup (PATH, services, permissions, auth files). Give them the **full source checkout** via
the hackable (git) install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://datzi.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --install-method git
```

This installs Datzi **from a git checkout**, so the agent can read the code + docs and
reason about the exact version you are running. You can always switch back to stable later
by re-running the installer without `--install-method git`.

Tip: ask the agent to **plan and supervise** the fix (step-by-step), then execute only the
necessary commands. That keeps changes small and easier to audit.

If you discover a real bug or fix, please file a GitHub issue or send a PR:
[https://github.com/datzi/datzi/issues](https://github.com/datzi/datzi/issues)
[https://github.com/datzi/datzi/pulls](https://github.com/datzi/datzi/pulls)

Start with these commands (share outputs when asking for help):

```bash
datzi status
datzi models status
datzi doctor
```

What they do:

- `datzi status`: quick snapshot of gateway/agent health + basic config.
- `datzi models status`: checks provider auth + model availability.
- `datzi doctor`: validates and repairs common config/state issues.

Other useful CLI checks: `datzi status --all`, `datzi logs --follow`,
`datzi gateway status`, `datzi health --verbose`.

### What's the recommended way to install and set up Datzi

The repo recommends running from source and using the onboarding wizard:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://datzi.ai/install.sh | bash
datzi onboard --install-daemon
```

The wizard can also build UI assets automatically. After onboarding, you typically run the Gateway on port **18789**.

From source (contributors/dev):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datzi/datzi.git
cd datzi
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm ui:build # auto-installs UI deps on first run
datzi onboard
```

If you don't have a global install yet, run it via `pnpm datzi onboard`.

### How do I open the dashboard after onboarding

The wizard opens your browser with a clean (non-tokenized) dashboard URL right after onboarding and also prints the link
in the summary. Keep that tab open; if it didn't launch, copy/paste the printed URL on the same machine.

### How do I authenticate the dashboard token on localhost vs remote

**Localhost (same machine):**

- Open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/`.
- If it asks for auth, paste the token from `gateway.auth.token` (or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`) into Control UI settings.
- Retrieve it from the gateway host: `datzi config get gateway.auth.token` (or generate one:
  `datzi doctor --generate-gateway-token`).

**Not on localhost:**

- **Tailscale Serve** (recommended): keep bind loopback, run `datzi gateway --tailscale serve`, open
  `https://<magicdns>/`. If `gateway.auth.allowTailscale` is `true`, identity headers satisfy Control UI/WebSocket
  auth (no token, assumes trusted gateway host); HTTP APIs still require token/password.
- **Tailnet bind**: run `datzi gateway --bind tailnet --token "<token>"`, open `http://<tailscale-ip>:18789/`, paste
  token in dashboard settings.
- **SSH tunnel**: `ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@host` then open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` and paste the token in
  Control UI settings.

See [Dashboard](/web/dashboard) and [Web surfaces](/web) for bind modes and auth details.

### What runtime do I need

Node **>= 22** is required. `pnpm` is recommended. Bun is **not recommended** for the Gateway.

### Does it run on Raspberry Pi

Yes. The Gateway is lightweight - docs list **512MB-1GB RAM**, **1 core**, and about **500MB**
disk as enough for personal use, and note that a **Raspberry Pi 4 can run it**.

If you want extra headroom (logs, media, other services), **2GB is recommended**, but it's
not a hard minimum.

Tip: a small Pi/VPS can host the Gateway, and you can pair **nodes** on your laptop/phone for
local screen/camera/canvas or command execution. See [Nodes](/nodes).

### Any tips for Raspberry Pi installs

Short version: it works, but expect rough edges.

- Use a **64-bit** OS and keep Node >= 22.
- Prefer the **hackable (git) install** so you can see logs and update fast.
- Start without channels/skills, then add them one by one.
- If you hit weird binary issues, it is usually an **ARM compatibility** problem.

Docs: [Linux](/platforms/linux), [Install](/install).

### It is stuck on wake up my friend onboarding will not hatch What now

That screen depends on the Gateway being reachable and authenticated. The TUI also sends
"Wake up, my friend!" automatically on first hatch. If you see that line with **no reply**
and tokens stay at 0, the agent never ran.

1. Restart the Gateway:

```bash
datzi gateway restart
```

2. Check status + auth:

```bash
datzi status
datzi models status
datzi logs --follow
```

3. If it still hangs, run:

```bash
datzi doctor
```

If the Gateway is remote, ensure the tunnel/Tailscale connection is up and that the UI
is pointed at the right Gateway. See [Remote access](/gateway/remote).

### Can I migrate my setup to a new machine Mac mini without redoing onboarding

Yes. Copy the **state directory** and **workspace**, then run Doctor once. This
keeps your bot "exactly the same" (memory, session history, auth, and channel
state) as long as you copy **both** locations:

1. Install Datzi on the new machine.
2. Copy `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` (default: `~/.datzi`) from the old machine.
3. Copy your workspace (default: `~/.datzi/workspace`).
4. Run `datzi doctor` and restart the Gateway service.

That preserves config, auth profiles, WhatsApp creds, sessions, and memory. If you're in
remote mode, remember the gateway host owns the session store and workspace.

**Important:** if you only commit/push your workspace to GitHub, you're backing
up **memory + bootstrap files**, but **not** session history or auth. Those live
under `~/.datzi/` (for example `~/.datzi/agents/<agentId>/sessions/`).

Related: [Migrating](/install/migrating), [Where things live on disk](/help/faq#where-does-datzi-store-its-data),
[Agent workspace](/concepts/agent-workspace), [Doctor](/gateway/doctor),
[Remote mode](/gateway/remote).

### Where do I see what is new in the latest version

Check the GitHub changelog:
[https://github.com/datzi/datzi/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/datzi/datzi/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

Newest entries are at the top. If the top section is marked **Unreleased**, the next dated
section is the latest shipped version. Entries are grouped by **Highlights**, **Changes**, and
**Fixes** (plus docs/other sections when needed).

### I can't access docs.datzi\.ai SSL error What now

Some Comcast/Xfinity connections incorrectly block `docs.datzi.ai` via Xfinity
Advanced Security. Disable it or allowlist `docs.datzi.ai`, then retry. More
detail: [Troubleshooting](/help/troubleshooting#docsdatziai-shows-an-ssl-error-comcastxfinity).
Please help us unblock it by reporting
here: [https://spa.xfinity.com/check_url_status](https://spa.xfinity.com/check_url_status).

If you still can't reach the site, the docs are mirrored on GitHub:
[https://github.com/datzi/datzi/tree/main/docs](https://github.com/datzi/datzi/tree/main/docs)

### What's the difference between stable and beta

**Stable** and **beta** are **npm dist-tags**, not separate code lines:

- `latest` = stable
- `beta` = early build for testing

We ship builds to **beta**, test them, and once a build is solid we **promote
that same version to `latest`**. That's why beta and stable can point at the
**same version**.

See what changed:
[https://github.com/datzi/datzi/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/datzi/datzi/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

### How do I install the beta version and what's the difference between beta and dev

**Beta** is the npm dist-tag `beta` (may match `latest`).
**Dev** is the moving head of `main` (git); when published, it uses the npm dist-tag `dev`.

One-liners (macOS/Linux):

```bash
curl -fsSL --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://datzi.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --beta
```

```bash
curl -fsSL --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://datzi.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --install-method git
```

Windows installer (PowerShell):
[https://datzi.ai/install.ps1](https://datzi.ai/install.ps1)

More detail: [Development channels](/install/development-channels) and [Installer flags](/install/installer).

### How long does install and onboarding usually take

Rough guide:

- **Install:** 2-5 minutes
- **Onboarding:** 5-15 minutes depending on how many channels/models you configure

If it hangs, use [Installer stuck](/help/faq#installer-stuck-how-do-i-get-more-feedback)
and the fast debug loop in [Im stuck](/help/faq#im-stuck--whats-the-fastest-way-to-get-unstuck).

### How do I try the latest bits

Two options:

1. **Dev channel (git checkout):**

```bash
datzi update --channel dev
```

This switches to the `main` branch and updates from source.

2. **Hackable install (from the installer site):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://datzi.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --install-method git
```

That gives you a local repo you can edit, then update via git.

If you prefer a clean clone manually, use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datzi/datzi.git
cd datzi
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Docs: [Update](/cli/update), [Development channels](/install/development-channels),
[Install](/install).

### Installer stuck How do I get more feedback

Re-run the installer with **verbose output**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://datzi.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --verbose
```

Beta install with verbose:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://datzi.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --beta --verbose
```

For a hackable (git) install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://datzi.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --install-method git --verbose
```

Windows (PowerShell) equivalent:

```powershell
# install.ps1 has no dedicated -Verbose flag yet.
Set-PSDebug -Trace 1
& ([scriptblock]::Create((iwr -useb https://datzi.ai/install.ps1))) -NoOnboard
Set-PSDebug -Trace 0
```

More options: [Installer flags](/install/installer).

### Windows install says git not found or datzi not recognized

Two common Windows issues:

**1) npm error spawn git / git not found**

- Install **Git for Windows** and make sure `git` is on your PATH.
- Close and reopen PowerShell, then re-run the installer.

**2) datzi is not recognized after install**

- Your npm global bin folder is not on PATH.

- Check the path:

  ```powershell
  npm config get prefix
  ```

- Ensure `<prefix>\\bin` is on PATH (on most systems it is `%AppData%\\npm`).

- Close and reopen PowerShell after updating PATH.

If you want the smoothest Windows setup, use **WSL2** instead of native Windows.
Docs: [Windows](/platforms/windows).

### The docs didn't answer my question how do I get a better answer

Use the **hackable (git) install** so you have the full source and docs locally, then ask
your bot (or Claude/Codex) _from that folder_ so it can read the repo and answer precisely.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://datzi.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --install-method git
```

More detail: [Install](/install) and [Installer flags](/install/installer).

### How do I install Datzi on Linux

Short answer: follow the Linux guide, then run the onboarding wizard.

- Linux quick path + service install: [Linux](/platforms/linux).
- Full walkthrough: [Getting Started](/start/getting-started).
- Installer + updates: [Install & updates](/install/updating).

### How do I install Datzi on a VPS

Any Linux VPS works. Install on the server, then use SSH/Tailscale to reach the Gateway.

Guides: [exe.dev](/install/exe-dev), [Hetzner](/install/hetzner), [Fly.io](/install/fly).
Remote access: [Gateway remote](/gateway/remote).

### Where are the cloudVPS install guides

We keep a **hosting hub** with the common providers. Pick one and follow the guide:

- [VPS hosting](/vps) (all providers in one place)
- [Fly.io](/install/fly)
- [Hetzner](/install/hetzner)
- [exe.dev](/install/exe-dev)

How it works in the cloud: the **Gateway runs on the server**, and you access it
from your laptop/phone via the Control UI (or Tailscale/SSH). Your state + workspace
live on the server, so treat the host as the source of truth and back it up.

You can pair **nodes** (Mac/iOS/Android/headless) to that cloud Gateway to access
local screen/camera/canvas or run commands on your laptop while keeping the
Gateway in the cloud.

Hub: [Platforms](/platforms). Remote access: [Gateway remote](/gateway/remote).
Nodes: [Nodes](/nodes), [Nodes CLI](/cli/nodes).

### Can I ask Datzi to update itself

Short answer: **possible, not recommended**. The update flow can restart the
Gateway (which drops the active session), may need a clean git checkout, and
can prompt for confirmation. Safer: run updates from a shell as the operator.

Use the CLI:

```bash
datzi update
datzi update status
datzi update --channel stable|beta|dev
datzi update --tag <dist-tag|version>
datzi update --no-restart
```

If you must automate from an agent:

```bash
datzi update --yes --no-restart
datzi gateway restart
```

Docs: [Update](/cli/update), [Updating](/install/updating).

### What does the onboarding wizard actually do

`datzi onboard` is the recommended setup path. In **local mode** it walks you through:

- **Model/auth setup** (Ollama local models recommended, API keys optional for other providers)
- **Workspace** location + bootstrap files
- **Gateway settings** (bind/port/auth/tailscale)
- **Providers** (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Mattermost (plugin), Signal, iMessage)
- **Daemon install** (LaunchAgent on macOS; systemd user unit on Linux/WSL2)
- **Health checks** and **skills** selection

It also warns if your configured model is unknown or missing auth.

### Do I need a Claude or OpenAI subscription to run this

No. Datzi runs 100% free with **Ollama local models** - no API key or subscription required. Your data stays on your device.

Docs: [Ollama](/providers/ollama), [Local models](/gateway/local-models), [Models](/concepts/models).

### Is AWS Bedrock supported

Yes, via manual config with AWS credentials. For a free local setup, use Ollama instead.

### How does Codex auth work

Codex OAuth supports OpenAI Codex paid subscriptions. For free local inference, use Ollama instead.

### Do you support OpenAI subscription auth Codex OAuth

Codex OAuth is supported for paid OpenAI subscriptions. For free local inference, use Ollama instead.

### Is a local model OK for casual chats

Yes, with a sufficiently large local model. Datzi works well with Ollama models like `qwen3-coder:32b` or `deepseek-r1:32b`. Use the largest model your hardware supports. See [Security](/gateway/security).

More context: [Models](/concepts/models).

### Can I use selfhosted models llamacpp vLLM Ollama

Yes. If your local server exposes an OpenAI-compatible API, you can point a
custom provider at it. Ollama is supported directly and is the easiest path.

Security note: smaller or heavily quantized models are more vulnerable to prompt
injection. We strongly recommend **large models** for any bot that can use tools.
If you still want small models, enable sandboxing and strict tool allowlists.

Docs: [Ollama](/providers/ollama), [Local models](/gateway/local-models),
[Model providers](/concepts/model-providers), [Security](/gateway/security),
[Sandboxing](/gateway/sandboxing).

### How do I switch models without wiping my config

Use **model commands** or edit only the **model** fields. Avoid full config replaces.

Safe options:

- `/model` in chat (quick, per-session)
- `datzi models set ...` (updates just model config)
- `datzi configure --section model` (interactive)
- edit `agents.defaults.model` in `~/.datzi/datzi.json`

Avoid `config.apply` with a partial object unless you intend to replace the whole config.
If you did overwrite config, restore from backup or re-run `datzi doctor` to repair.

Docs: [Models](/concepts/models), [Configure](/cli/configure), [Config](/cli/config), [Doctor](/gateway/doctor).

### What do Datzi, Flawd, and Krill use for models

- **Datzi + Flawd:** Ollama (`ollama/qwen3-coder:32b`) - see [Ollama](/providers/ollama).
- **Krill:** MiniMax M2.1 (`minimax/MiniMax-M2.1`) - see [MiniMax](/providers/minimax).

### How do I switch models on the fly without restarting

Use the `/model` command as a standalone message:

```
/model sonnet
/model haiku
/model opus
/model gpt
/model ollama/qwen3-coder:32b
/model gemini
/model gemini-flash
```

You can list available models with `/model`, `/model list`, or `/model status`.

`/model` (and `/model list`) shows a compact, numbered picker. Select by number:

```
/model 3
```

You can also force a specific auth profile for the provider (per session):

```
/model opus@anthropic:default
/model opus@anthropic:work
```

Tip: `/model status` shows which agent is active, which `auth-profiles.json` file is being used, and which auth profile
will be tried next.
It also shows the configured provider endpoint (`baseUrl`) and API mode (`api`) when available.

**How do I unpin a profile I set with profile**

Re-run `/model` **without** the `@profile` suffix:

```
/model ollama/qwen3-coder:32b
```

If you want to return to the default, pick it from `/model` (or send `/model <default provider/model>`).
Use `/model status` to confirm which auth profile is active.

### Can I use GPT 5.2 for daily tasks and Codex 5.3 for coding

Yes. Set one as default and switch as needed:

- **Quick switch (per session):** `/model ollama/qwen3-coder:32b` for daily tasks, `/model ollama/qwen3-coder:32b` for coding.
- **Default + switch:** set `agents.defaults.model.primary` to `ollama/deepseek-r1:32b`, then switch to
  `ollama/qwen3-coder:32b` when coding (or the other way around).
- **Sub-agents:** route coding tasks to sub-agents with a different default model.

See [Models](/concepts/models) and [Slash commands](/tools/slash-commands).

### Why do I see Model is not allowed and then no reply

If `agents.defaults.models` is set, it becomes the **allowlist** for `/model` and any
session overrides. Choosing a model that isn't in that list returns:

```
Model "provider/model" is not allowed. Use /model to list available models.
```

That error is returned **instead of** a normal reply. Fix: add the model to
`agents.defaults.models`, remove the allowlist, or pick a model from `/model list`.

### Why do I see Unknown model minimaxMiniMaxM21

This means the **provider isn't configured** (no MiniMax provider config or auth
profile was found), so the model can't be resolved. A fix for this detection is
in **2026.1.12** (unreleased at the time of writing).

Fix checklist:

1. Upgrade to **2026.1.12** (or run from source `main`), then restart the gateway.
2. Make sure MiniMax is configured (wizard or JSON), or that a MiniMax API key
   exists in env/auth profiles so the provider can be injected.
3. Use the exact model id (case-sensitive): `minimax/MiniMax-M2.1` or
   `minimax/MiniMax-M2.1-lightning`.
4. Run:

   ```bash
   datzi models list
   ```

   and pick from the list (or `/model list` in chat).

See [MiniMax](/providers/minimax) and [Models](/concepts/models).

### Can I use MiniMax as my default and OpenAI for complex tasks

Yes. Use **MiniMax as the default** and switch models **per session** when needed.
Fallbacks are for **errors**, not "hard tasks," so use `/model` or a separate agent.

**Option A: switch per session**

```json5
{
  env: {
    MINIMAX_API_KEY: 'sk-...'
  },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: {
        primary: 'minimax/MiniMax-M2.1'
      },
      models: {
        'minimax/MiniMax-M2.1': {
          alias: 'minimax'
        },
        'ollama/deepseek-r1:32b': {
          alias: 'gpt'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then:

```
/model gpt
```

**Option B: separate agents**

- Agent A default: MiniMax
- Agent B default: OpenAI
- Route by agent or use `/agent` to switch

Docs: [Models](/concepts/models), [Multi-Agent Routing](/concepts/multi-agent), [MiniMax](/providers/minimax), [OpenAI](/providers/openai).

### Are opus sonnet gpt builtin shortcuts

Yes. Datzi ships a few default shorthands (only applied when the model exists in `agents.defaults.models`):

- `ollama` → `ollama/qwen3-coder:32b`
- `deepseek` → `ollama/deepseek-r1:32b`

If you set your own alias with the same name, your value wins.

### How do I defineoverride model shortcuts aliases

Aliases come from `agents.defaults.models.<modelId>.alias`. Example:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: {
        primary: 'ollama/qwen3-coder:32b'
      },
      models: {
        'ollama/qwen3-coder:32b': {
          alias: 'opus'
        },
        'ollama/qwen3-coder:14b': {
          alias: 'sonnet'
        },
        'ollama/qwen3-coder:14b': {
          alias: 'haiku'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then `/model sonnet` (or `/<alias>` when supported) resolves to that model ID.

### How do I add models from other providers like OpenRouter or ZAI

Z.AI (GLM models):

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: {
        primary: 'zai/glm-4.7'
      },
      models: {
        'zai/glm-4.7': {}
      }
    }
  },
  env: {
    ZAI_API_KEY: '...'
  }
}
```

If you reference a provider/model but the required provider key is missing, you'll get a runtime auth error (e.g.
`No API key found for provider "zai"`).

**No API key found for provider after adding a new agent**

This usually means the **new agent** has an empty auth store. Auth is per-agent and
stored in:

```
~/.datzi/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json
```

Fix options:

- Run `datzi agents add <id>` and configure auth during the wizard.
- Or copy `auth-profiles.json` from the main agent's `agentDir` into the new agent's `agentDir`.

Do **not** reuse `agentDir` across agents; it causes auth/session collisions.

## Model failover and "All models failed"

### How does failover work

Failover happens in two stages:

1. **Auth profile rotation** within the same provider.
2. **Model fallback** to the next model in `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks`.

Cooldowns apply to failing profiles (exponential backoff), so Datzi can keep responding even when a provider is
rate-limited or temporarily failing.

### What does this error mean

```
No credentials found for profile "anthropic:default"
```

It means the system attempted to use the auth profile ID `anthropic:default`, but could not find credentials for it in
the expected auth store.

### Why did it also try Google Gemini and fail

If your model config includes Google Gemini as a fallback (or you switched to a Gemini shorthand), Datzi will try it
during model fallback. If you haven't configured Google credentials, you'll see`No API key found for provider "google"`.

Fix: either provide Google auth, or remove/avoid Google models in `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks` / aliases so
fallback doesn't route there.

**LLM request rejected message thinking signature required google antigravity**

Cause: the session history contains **thinking blocks without signatures** (often from
an aborted/partial stream). Google Antigravity requires signatures for thinking blocks.

Fix: Datzi now strips unsigned thinking blocks for Google Antigravity Claude. If it still appears, start a **new session
** or set `/thinking off` for that agent.

## Auth profiles: what they are and how to manage them

Related: [/concepts/oauth](/concepts/oauth) (OAuth flows, token storage, multi-account patterns)

### What is an auth profile

An auth profile is a named credential record (OAuth or API key) tied to a provider. Profiles live in:

```
~/.datzi/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json
```

### What are typical profile IDs

Datzi uses provider-prefixed IDs like:

- `anthropic:default` (common when no email identity exists)
- `anthropic:<email>` for OAuth identities
- custom IDs you choose (e.g. `anthropic:work`)

### Can I control which auth profile is tried first

Yes. Config supports optional metadata for profiles and an ordering per provider (`auth.order.<provider>`). This does \*
\*not\*\* store secrets; it maps IDs to provider/mode and sets rotation order.

Datzi may temporarily skip a profile if it's in a short **cooldown** (rate limits/timeouts/auth failures) or a longer \*
_disabled\*\* state (billing/insufficient credits). To inspect this, run `datzi models status --json` and check
`auth.unusableProfiles`. Tuning: `auth.cooldowns.billingBackoffHours_`.

You can also set a **per-agent** order override (stored in that agent's `auth-profiles.json`) via the CLI:

```bash
# Defaults to the configured default agent (omit --agent)
datzi models auth order get --provider anthropic

# Lock rotation to a single profile (only try this one)
datzi models auth order set --provider anthropic anthropic:default

# Or set an explicit order (fallback within provider)
datzi models auth order set --provider anthropic anthropic:work anthropic:default

# Clear override (fall back to config auth.order / round-robin)
datzi models auth order clear --provider anthropic
```

To target a specific agent:

```bash
datzi models auth order set --provider anthropic --agent main anthropic:default
```

### OAuth vs API key what's the difference

Datzi supports both:

- **OAuth** often leverages subscription access (where applicable).
- **API keys** use pay-per-token billing.

The wizard explicitly supports Anthropic setup-token and OpenAI Codex OAuth and can store API keys for you.

## Gateway: ports, "already running", and remote mode

### What port does the Gateway use

`gateway.port` controls the single multiplexed port for WebSocket + HTTP (Control UI, hooks, etc.).

Precedence:

```
--port > OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT > gateway.port > default 18789
```

### Why does datzi gateway status say Runtime running but RPC probe failed

Because "running" is the **supervisor's** view (launchd/systemd/schtasks). The RPC probe is the CLI actually connecting
to the gateway WebSocket and calling `status`.

Use `datzi gateway status` and trust these lines:

- `Probe target:` (the URL the probe actually used)
- `Listening:` (what's actually bound on the port)
- `Last gateway error:` (common root cause when the process is alive but the port isn't listening)

### Why does datzi gateway status show Config cli and Config service different

You're editing one config file while the service is running another (often a `--profile` / `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`
mismatch).

Fix:

```bash
datzi gateway install --force
```

Run that from the same `--profile` / environment you want the service to use.

### What does another gateway instance is already listening mean

Datzi enforces a runtime lock by binding the WebSocket listener immediately on startup (default `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`).
If the bind fails with `EADDRINUSE`, it throws `GatewayLockError` indicating another instance is already listening.

Fix: stop the other instance, free the port, or run with `datzi gateway --port <port>`.

### How do I run Datzi in remote mode client connects to a Gateway elsewhere

Set `gateway.mode: "remote"` and point to a remote WebSocket URL, optionally with a token/password:

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    mode: 'remote',
    remote: {
      url: 'ws://gateway.tailnet:18789',
      token: 'your-token',
      password: 'your-password'
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `datzi gateway` only starts when `gateway.mode` is `local` (or you pass the override flag).
- The macOS app watches the config file and switches modes live when these values change.

### The Control UI says unauthorized or keeps reconnecting What now

Your gateway is running with auth enabled (`gateway.auth.*`), but the UI is not sending the matching token/password.

Facts (from code):

- The Control UI stores the token in browser localStorage key `datzi.control.settings.v1`.

Fix:

- Fastest: `datzi dashboard` (prints + copies the dashboard URL, tries to open; shows SSH hint if headless).
- If you don't have a token yet: `datzi doctor --generate-gateway-token`.
- If remote, tunnel first: `ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@host` then open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/`.
- Set `gateway.auth.token` (or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`) on the gateway host.
- In the Control UI settings, paste the same token.
- Still stuck? Run `datzi status --all` and follow [Troubleshooting](/gateway/troubleshooting).
  See [Dashboard](/web/dashboard) for auth details.

### I set gatewaybind tailnet but it can't bind nothing listens

`tailnet` bind picks a Tailscale IP from your network interfaces (100.64.0.0/10). If the machine isn't on Tailscale (or
the interface is down), there's nothing to bind to.

Fix:

- Start Tailscale on that host (so it has a 100.x address), or
- Switch to `gateway.bind: "loopback"` / `"lan"`.

Note: `tailnet` is explicit. `auto` prefers loopback; use `gateway.bind: "tailnet"` when you want a tailnet-only bind.

### Can I run multiple Gateways on the same host

Usually no - one Gateway can run multiple messaging channels and agents. Use multiple Gateways only when you need
redundancy (ex: rescue bot) or hard isolation.

Yes, but you must isolate:

- `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` (per-instance config)
- `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` (per-instance state)
- `agents.defaults.workspace` (workspace isolation)
- `gateway.port` (unique ports)

Quick setup (recommended):

- Use `datzi --profile <name> …` per instance (auto-creates `~/.datzi-<name>`).
- Set a unique `gateway.port` in each profile config (or pass `--port` for manual runs).
- Install a per-profile service: `datzi --profile <name> gateway install`.

Profiles also suffix service names (`bot.molt.<profile>`; legacy `com.datzi.*`, `datzi-gateway-<profile>.service`,
`Datzi Gateway (<profile>)`).
Full guide: [Multiple gateways](/gateway/multiple-gateways).

### What does invalid handshake code 1008 mean

The Gateway is a **WebSocket server**, and it expects the very first message to
be a `connect` frame. If it receives anything else, it closes the connection
with **code 1008** (policy violation).

Common causes:

- You opened the **HTTP** URL in a browser (`http://...`) instead of a WS client.
- You used the wrong port or path.
- A proxy or tunnel stripped auth headers or sent a non-Gateway request.

Quick fixes:

1. Use the WS URL: `ws://<host>:18789` (or `wss://...` if HTTPS).
2. Don't open the WS port in a normal browser tab.
3. If auth is on, include the token/password in the `connect` frame.

If you're using the CLI or TUI, the URL should look like:

```
datzi tui --url ws://<host>:18789 --token <token>
```

Protocol details: [Gateway protocol](/gateway/protocol).

## Logging and debugging

### Where are logs

File logs (structured):

```
/tmp/datzi/datzi-YYYY-MM-DD.log
```

You can set a stable path via `logging.file`. File log level is controlled by `logging.level`. Console verbosity is
controlled by `--verbose` and `logging.consoleLevel`.

Fastest log tail:

```bash
datzi logs --follow
```

Service/supervisor logs (when the gateway runs via launchd/systemd):

- macOS: `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/logs/gateway.log` and `gateway.err.log` (default: `~/.datzi/logs/...`; profiles use
  `~/.datzi-<profile>/logs/...`)
- Linux: `journalctl --user -u datzi-gateway[-<profile>].service -n 200 --no-pager`
- Windows: `schtasks /Query /TN "Datzi Gateway (<profile>)" /V /FO LIST`

See [Troubleshooting](/gateway/troubleshooting#log-locations) for more.

### How do I start/stop/restart the Gateway service

Use the gateway helpers:

```bash
datzi gateway status
datzi gateway restart
```

If you run the gateway manually, `datzi gateway --force` can reclaim the port. See [Gateway](/gateway).

### I closed my terminal on Windows how do I restart Datzi

There are **two Windows install modes**:

**1) WSL2 (recommended):** the Gateway runs inside Linux.

Open PowerShell, enter WSL, then restart:

```powershell
wsl
datzi gateway status
datzi gateway restart
```

If you never installed the service, start it in the foreground:

```bash
datzi gateway run
```

**2) Native Windows (not recommended):** the Gateway runs directly in Windows.

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
datzi gateway status
datzi gateway restart
```

If you run it manually (no service), use:

```powershell
datzi gateway run
```

Docs: [Windows (WSL2)](/platforms/windows), [Gateway service runbook](/gateway).

### The Gateway is up but replies never arrive What should I check

Start with a quick health sweep:

```bash
datzi status
datzi models status
datzi channels status
datzi logs --follow
```

Common causes:

- Model auth not loaded on the **gateway host** (check `models status`).
- Channel pairing/allowlist blocking replies (check channel config + logs).
- WebChat/Dashboard is open without the right token.

If you are remote, confirm the tunnel/Tailscale connection is up and that the
Gateway WebSocket is reachable.

Docs: [Channels](/channels), [Troubleshooting](/gateway/troubleshooting), [Remote access](/gateway/remote).

### Disconnected from gateway no reason what now

This usually means the UI lost the WebSocket connection. Check:

1. Is the Gateway running? `datzi gateway status`
2. Is the Gateway healthy? `datzi status`
3. Does the UI have the right token? `datzi dashboard`
4. If remote, is the tunnel/Tailscale link up?

Then tail logs:

```bash
datzi logs --follow
```

Docs: [Dashboard](/web/dashboard), [Remote access](/gateway/remote), [Troubleshooting](/gateway/troubleshooting).

### Telegram setMyCommands fails with network errors What should I check

Start with logs and channel status:

```bash
datzi channels status
datzi channels logs --channel telegram
```

If you are on a VPS or behind a proxy, confirm outbound HTTPS is allowed and DNS works.
If the Gateway is remote, make sure you are looking at logs on the Gateway host.

Docs: [Telegram](/channels/telegram), [Channel troubleshooting](/channels/troubleshooting).

### TUI shows no output What should I check

First confirm the Gateway is reachable and the agent can run:

```bash
datzi status
datzi models status
datzi logs --follow
```

In the TUI, use `/status` to see the current state. If you expect replies in a chat
channel, make sure delivery is enabled (`/deliver on`).

Docs: [TUI](/web/tui), [Slash commands](/tools/slash-commands).

### How do I completely stop then start the Gateway

If you installed the service:

```bash
datzi gateway stop
datzi gateway start
```

This stops/starts the **supervised service** (launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux).
Use this when the Gateway runs in the background as a daemon.

If you're running in the foreground, stop with Ctrl-C, then:

```bash
datzi gateway run
```

Docs: [Gateway service runbook](/gateway).

### ELI5 datzi gateway restart vs datzi gateway

- `datzi gateway restart`: restarts the **background service** (launchd/systemd).
- `datzi gateway`: runs the gateway **in the foreground** for this terminal session.

If you installed the service, use the gateway commands. Use `datzi gateway` when
you want a one-off, foreground run.

### What's the fastest way to get more details when something fails

Start the Gateway with `--verbose` to get more console detail. Then inspect the log file for channel auth, model
routing, and RPC errors.

## Media and attachments

### My skill generated an imagePDF but nothing was sent

Outbound attachments from the agent must include a `MEDIA:<path-or-url>` line (on its own line).
See [Datzi assistant setup](/start/datzi) and [Agent send](/tools/agent-send).

CLI sending:

```bash
datzi message send --target +15555550123 --message "Here you go" --media /path/to/file.png
```

Also check:

- The target channel supports outbound media and isn't blocked by allowlists.
- The file is within the provider's size limits (images are resized to max 2048px).

See [Images](/nodes/images).

## Security and access control

### Is it safe to expose Datzi to inbound DMs

Treat inbound DMs as untrusted input. Defaults are designed to reduce risk:

- Default behavior on DM-capable channels is **pairing**:
  - Unknown senders receive a pairing code; the bot does not process their message.
  - Approve with: `datzi pairing approve <channel> <code>`
  - Pending requests are capped at **3 per channel**; check `datzi pairing list <channel>` if a code didn't arrive.
- Opening DMs publicly requires explicit opt-in (`dmPolicy: "open"` and allowlist `"*"`).

Run `datzi doctor` to surface risky DM policies.

### Is prompt injection only a concern for public bots

No. Prompt injection is about **untrusted content**, not just who can DM the bot.
If your assistant reads external content (web search/fetch, browser pages, emails,
docs, attachments, pasted logs), that content can include instructions that try
to hijack the model. This can happen even if **you are the only sender**.

The biggest risk is when tools are enabled: the model can be tricked into
exfiltrating context or calling tools on your behalf. Reduce the blast radius by:

- using a read-only or tool-disabled "reader" agent to summarize untrusted content
- keeping `web_search` / `web_fetch` / `browser` off for tool-enabled agents
- sandboxing and strict tool allowlists

Details: [Security](/gateway/security).

### Should my bot have its own email GitHub account or phone number

Yes, for most setups. Isolating the bot with separate accounts and phone numbers
reduces the blast radius if something goes wrong. This also makes it easier to rotate
credentials or revoke access without impacting your personal accounts.

Start small. Give access only to the tools and accounts you actually need, and expand
later if required.

Docs: [Security](/gateway/security), [Pairing](/channels/pairing).

### Can I give it autonomy over my text messages and is that safe

We do **not** recommend full autonomy over your personal messages. The safest pattern is:

- Keep DMs in **pairing mode** or a tight allowlist.
- Use a **separate number or account** if you want it to message on your behalf.
- Let it draft, then **approve before sending**.

If you want to experiment, do it on a dedicated account and keep it isolated. See
[Security](/gateway/security).

### Can I use cheaper models for personal assistant tasks

Yes, **if** the agent is chat-only and the input is trusted. Smaller tiers are
more susceptible to instruction hijacking, so avoid them for tool-enabled agents
or when reading untrusted content. If you must use a smaller model, lock down
tools and run inside a sandbox. See [Security](/gateway/security).

### I ran start in Telegram but didn't get a pairing code

Pairing codes are sent **only** when an unknown sender messages the bot and
`dmPolicy: "pairing"` is enabled. `/start` by itself doesn't generate a code.

Check pending requests:

```bash
datzi pairing list telegram
```

If you want immediate access, allowlist your sender id or set `dmPolicy: "open"`
for that account.

### WhatsApp will it message my contacts How does pairing work

No. Default WhatsApp DM policy is **pairing**. Unknown senders only get a pairing code and their message is **not
processed**. Datzi only replies to chats it receives or to explicit sends you trigger.

Approve pairing with:

```bash
datzi pairing approve whatsapp <code>
```

List pending requests:

```bash
datzi pairing list whatsapp
```

Wizard phone number prompt: it's used to set your **allowlist/owner** so your own DMs are permitted. It's not used for
auto-sending. If you run on your personal WhatsApp number, use that number and enable `channels.whatsapp.selfChatMode`.

## Chat commands, aborting tasks, and "it won't stop"

### How do I stop internal system messages from showing in chat

Most internal or tool messages only appear when **verbose** or **reasoning** is enabled
for that session.

Fix in the chat where you see it:

```
/verbose off
/reasoning off
```

If it is still noisy, check the session settings in the Control UI and set verbose
to **inherit**. Also confirm you are not using a bot profile with `verboseDefault` set
to `on` in config.

Docs: [Thinking and verbose](/tools/thinking), [Security](/gateway/security#reasoning--verbose-output-in-groups).

### How do I stopcancel a running task

Send any of these **as a standalone message** (no slash):

```
stop
abort
esc
wait
exit
interrupt
```

These are abort triggers (not slash commands).

For background processes (from the exec tool), you can ask the agent to run:

```
process action:kill sessionId:XXX
```

Slash commands overview: see [Slash commands](/tools/slash-commands).

Most commands must be sent as a **standalone** message that starts with `/`, but a few shortcuts (like `/status`) also
work inline for allowlisted senders.

### How do I send a Discord message from Telegram Crosscontext messaging denied

Datzi blocks **cross-provider** messaging by default. If a tool call is bound
to Telegram, it won't send to Discord unless you explicitly allow it.

Enable cross-provider messaging for the agent:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      tools: {
        message: {
          crossContext: {
            allowAcrossProviders: true,
            marker: {
              enabled: true,
              prefix: '[from {channel}] '
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the gateway after editing config. If you only want this for a single
agent, set it under `agents.list[].tools.message` instead.

### Why does it feel like the bot ignores rapidfire messages

Queue mode controls how new messages interact with an in-flight run. Use `/queue` to change modes:

- `steer` - new messages redirect the current task
- `followup` - run messages one at a time
- `collect` - batch messages and reply once (default)
- `steer-backlog` - steer now, then process backlog
- `interrupt` - abort current run and start fresh

You can add options like `debounce:2s cap:25 drop:summarize` for followup modes.

## Answer the exact question from the screenshot/chat log

**Q: "What's the default model for Anthropic with an API key?"**

**A:** In Datzi, the default model is whatever you configure in `agents.defaults.model.primary` (for example, `ollama/qwen3-coder:32b`). For Ollama, no API key is required.
