# Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains helper scripts for local workflows and ops tasks.
Use these when a task is clearly tied to a script; otherwise prefer the CLI.

## Conventions

- Scripts are **optional** unless referenced in docs or release checklists.
- Prefer CLI surfaces when they exist (example: auth monitoring uses `datzi models status --check`).
- Assume scripts are host‑specific; read them before running on a new machine.

## Auth monitoring scripts

Auth monitoring scripts are documented here:
[/automation/auth-monitoring](/automation/auth-monitoring)

## When adding scripts

- Keep scripts focused and documented.
- Add a short entry in the relevant doc (or create one if missing).
