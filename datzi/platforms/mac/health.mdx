# Health Checks on macOS

How to see whether the linked channel is healthy from the menu bar app.

## Menu bar

- Status dot now reflects Baileys health:
  - Green: linked + socket opened recently.
  - Orange: connecting/retrying.
  - Red: logged out or probe failed.
- Secondary line reads "linked · auth 12m" or shows the failure reason.
- "Run Health Check" menu item triggers an on-demand probe.

## Settings

- General tab gains a Health card showing: linked auth age, session-store path/count, last check time, last error/status
  code, and buttons for Run Health Check / Reveal Logs.
- Uses a cached snapshot so the UI loads instantly and falls back gracefully when offline.
- **Channels tab** surfaces channel status + controls for WhatsApp/Telegram (login QR, logout, probe, last
  disconnect/error).

## How the probe works

- App runs `datzi health --json` via `ShellExecutor` every \~60s and on demand. The probe loads creds and reports
  status without sending messages.
- Cache the last good snapshot and the last error separately to avoid flicker; show the timestamp of each.

## When in doubt

- You can still use the CLI flow in [Gateway health](/gateway/health) (`datzi status`, `datzi status --deep`,
  `datzi health --json`) and tail `/tmp/datzi/datzi-*.log` for `web-heartbeat` / `web-reconnect`.
